## General Information
- This project is a case study on bike sharing demand(BoomBikes) by UpGrad
- Wherein the company has contracted a consulting company to understand the factors on which the demand for these shared bikes depends.
- Specifically, they want to understand the factors affecting the demand for these shared bikes in the American market.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Looking at the beta co-efficient values, the top 3 influencing variables would be temp, yr and windspeed
- These features alone can be used to plan better and improve the bike registrations count

Feature Details:
- temp : temperature in Celsius
- yr : registration year
- windspeed : wind speed
